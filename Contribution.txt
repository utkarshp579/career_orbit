ðŸš€ Steps to Contribute to an Open Source Repo (Fork â†’ Fix â†’ PR)
1. Fork the Repository

Go to the original repo (example: piyush-eon/ai-career-coach).

Click Fork â†’ creates a copy under your account (utkarshp579/ai-career-coach).

2. Clone Your Fork
git clone https://github.com/utkarshp579/ai-career-coach.git
cd ai-career-coach

3. Set Upstream Remote (only once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/piyush-eon/ai-career-coach.git
git remote -v


origin â†’ your fork

upstream â†’ original repo

4. Sync Your Fork with Upstream

Before starting new work, always update:

git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master

5. Create a New Branch

Always make changes in a separate branch:

git checkout -b fix/enum-value-case


(Branch name format: fix/..., feat/..., docs/... etc.)

6. Make Your Changes

Update code, fix bugs, or add features.

In this case: fixed enum values (DemandLevel, MarketOutlook) to uppercase.

7. Stage & Commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: align enum values to uppercase (DemandLevel, MarketOutlook)"

8. Push Your Branch to Fork
git push origin fix/enum-value-case

9. Open a Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub.

Click Compare & pull request.

Set:

Base repo = piyush-eon/ai-career-coach

Base branch = master

Compare = fix/enum-value-case

Add a title (short, conventional commit style) and description (explain problem â†’ solution â†’ impact).

Example Title:

fix: align enum values to uppercase (DemandLevel, MarketOutlook)

10. Wait for Review

Maintainer reviews and merges.

If deployment checks (like Vercel) fail due to authorization, ignore â€” thatâ€™s for repo maintainers.

11. (Optional) Keep Fork Updated

When new changes are merged in upstream:

git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master


âœ… Thatâ€™s the full loop: Fork â†’ Clone â†’ Upstream â†’ Sync â†’ Branch â†’ Fix â†’ Commit â†’ Push â†’ PR â†’ Review â†’ Merge.
